  <h1>The Universe</h1>
  <p>The term Universe is derived from the Latin word universum. Cicero and later authors used the Latin word in the same sense that it is used today. The Latin word is derived from the poetic contraction unvorsum, which Lucretius first used in Book IV of his "On the Nature of Things" and connects un, uni (one) with vorsum, versum (which means "something turned, rolled or changed" ).</p>
